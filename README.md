### Continued development

I made every effort to construct my code using the most optimal and effective solutions during the development phase of this project. However, in certain situations, I had to resort to unconventional approaches that may not be entirely logical but still manage to produce the desired results, partially. I intend to address these issues in the future and rectify them accordingly (hopefully). For example, using empty ``` <p></p> ``` tag might not be the best solution but I will fix it with a better solution later.

```html
<div class="box">
    <h5 id="h5-year">Year</h5>
    <input id=year type="number" placeholder=YYYY>
    <p id="errorYear"></p>
</div>
```

## Acknowledgments

I received assistance during the coding process from an AI-powered assistant called ChatGPT and consulted previously asked questions on the internet, particularly on platforms like Stack Overflow, while leveraging my own knowledge and putting in personal effort.
